# london_housing_case_study
Part of the Springboard DataScience course, this is a case study regarding London housing prices by borough and it's increase over the years. 

Project Overview
The question you are trying to solve: Which borough of London has seen the greatest average increase in housing prices in (approximately) two decades covered by the dataset? 

Context
There are 32 boroughs in Greater London, each with individual governing bodies. As you can imagine, some of them are more desirable to live in than others, and will reflect the desirability in the greater rise in housing prices.
